           Eleanor and Park awarded as the New York Time's Best selling novel by Rainbow Rowell revolves
           around the lives and bond between two high school teens Eleanor and Park.Eleanor,a red head
           belongs to a family where everyone is afraid of her abusive father.Park on the other hand 
           comes from a loving korean family.He never really had trouble with making friends at school
           but fitting in?well,that's whole other problem.
           <br><br>
           When Eleanor and Park meet on the school bus they are forced to sit next to each other.One day while Park read a comic book,he found Eleanor staring at the book as surreptitiously as she could.Sooner rather than later sharing comic books lead to sharing music and later escalated to Park making music tapes for Eleanor.In a world where Eleanor could never see herself as anything other than "big and awkward",Park saw Eleanor as art,and art wasnâ€™t supposed to look nice,it was supposed to make you feel something.
           <br><br>
           With the passage of time both end up falling in love with each other.As the story proceeds and everyone seems to want good for the two of them but well "life's a bastard".The story seems to be ending on a bleak note but when it's love,love finds a way
           <br><br>
           So,grab the book and tissue box and get to reading.
           <br>
           Until next time :)
