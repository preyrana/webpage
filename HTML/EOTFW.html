    The story revolves around two kids James and Alyssa.The series starts on a bothersome and dark note 
    as we witness James "the supposed protagonist",killing animals,upon further narration we come to know that he believes his father to be a prick and suffers from surviver's guilt from failure of saving his mother from suicide and later turning him numb to everything.
    <br><br>
    James craving to feel something instead of a void,starts out on an animal killing spree but when that doesn't work,he thinks of going one step further and killing a human.Call it faith,but for once James felt like the prey(Alyssa) had walked right upto the predator.
    <br><br>
    Alyssa comes from a home where she feels unsafe because of her step father and her biological mother who never tells him to maintain his boundaries.So when she runs into James,an outcast.She wants him to be her boyfriend.When James asks her out on a date she says yes,later on the date after yelling at the waitress James takes Alyssa where she meets Jame's father and they both agree that he is a prick.
    <br><br>
    Alyssa,bored from the monotones of life convinces James to run away with her.Later they end up in a deserted house for the night,soon to be occupied by the actual owner who is infact a sex predator and sees killing women as a crime of passion.When Alyssa is attacked by Topher,James in an attempt to save Allysa ends up killing him.
    <br><br>
    After a series of events that only get darker and sadder James finally realises that he has started loving Alyssa but faith does'nt always favour people.What amazed me about the show is how easy it was to get attached to two seemingly unlikable characters. James and Alyssa are probably not the best people you will ever see,but I have to admit they are relatable to quite some extent, the chemistry between them makes you root for and sympathize with them on their deranged 'Bonnie and Clyde' style trip across Britain. Props to the actors/writers for making that happen.The scene where James sees Alyssa after 2 whole years and realises that "when you see the people you love after a long time,it get easier to breathe"is undoubtedly my favourite scene
